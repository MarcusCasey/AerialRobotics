# AerialRobotics
My work regarding aerial robotics, as well as computer vision detection for humans in crisis scenarios.

To execute program cd into ir_hog directory

Enter:

python IAR.py images


If you would like to add more images to be processed, simply add them in PNG form to the images folder. You are able to delete applied folder at any time; the program will re-create the folder based on the images folder. If you would like to apply the program to another image type, see line 65 however only png’s were tested.


Libraries required:

Many libraries were installed in the creation of this program. In our documentation only OpenCV should be required. If you do run into any library issue, please email marcuscasey@unr.edu and I will ensure that we did not miss an include. Python 3 was used in running of this program.
